      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is added to the
      homescreen on Android. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <p>If you use Facebbook with any regularity, they have an astonishing amount of information about you.</p>
    <p>You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992?helpref=hc_global_nav">download your data</a> from Facebook in a <strong>JSON</strong> format and visualise it here.</p>
    <p>Select the zip file and drop it below. No data is uploaded when using this service. All data processing is done in the browser not on our servers. </p>
    <p>As you will see the data you give to Facebook can be quite personal and sometimes revealing. We hope you will not upload it anywhere and be more aware of what Facebook can do with your data.</p>
